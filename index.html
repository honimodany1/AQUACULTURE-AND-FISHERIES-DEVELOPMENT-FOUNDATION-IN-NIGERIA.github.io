                <h3>INTRODUCTION </h3>

                <p>The name aquaculture and fisheries may be new to some people but the activities of aquaculture are not. Most people know aquaculture by the name ‘FISH FARMING”, which is correct. In the actual sense, aquaculture (also under water agriculture)
                    is the cultivation and harvesting of animals and plants such as finfish, shellfish and sea weeds in the water Fisheries at the other hand are the harvesting of the water animals from the wild or from aquaculture. It could be fresh
                    water, marine water or brackish water. Aquaculture and Fisheries development is all about making nutritious food available for everyone to fight hunger and malnutrition. This can only be achieved on a sustainable basis by the involvement
                    of individuals, families, communities, organizations and the government. Medical research into the health benefits of eating fish is that Omega-3 fatty acids, which are typically found in most fish, help reduce many forms of cancer
                    and promote healthy brain tissue. Eating fish regularly has also been shown to reduce the risk of heart disease through reducing the probability of clot formation, lowering blood pressure and increasing the good cholesterol levels
                    in the blood stream.
                </p>

                <h3>FROM THE CEO'S DESK </h3>
                <p style="text-align: center;">Aquaculture without a strategic planning, including research cannot yield dividend. In Nigeria, we fail in aquaculture because there is no adequate planning, from the government to the fish farmers. Again, most fish farms are operating
                    as backyard fish farms. Aquaculture and Fisheries Development Foundation in Nigeria is coming up with something different. We are going to divide aquaculture investment into two systems based on the aquatic ecosystems in Nigeria.<br>                    1) The marine and brackish waters. This will include the Atlantic Ocean and deltas.<br> 2) The inland fresh waters. This will include inland water ways, <br>the Niger and the Benue basins, all the wetlands and Lake Chad. In the marine
                    and brackish waters, the following supporting equipments will be used:<br> 1) Submersible cages and other highly technological methods to into Open Ocean fish farming.<br> 2) National hatcheries for finfish and shellfish.<br> 3)Feed
                    mills.
                    <br> 4) Post harvest centers.<br> 5) Research and disease control centers. In the inland freshwaters, the technique that is going to be used will be determined by the fish expert consultants. Again, the following supporting equipments
                    will be employed:<br> 1) Hatcheries<br> 2) Feed mills<br> 3) Post harvest centers<br> 4) Research and disease control centers.I want to encourage the Nigeria populace to buy the culture of team working, come together and teamwork for
                    the success of aquaculture in Nigeria. The fish farmers and upcoming farmers are encouraged to join by registering with AFDFIN. Finally, I call on the government, companies whose corporate social responsibility are to help in a pathetic
                    situation that we find ourselves in Nigeria, eminent Patriots, fish farmers, fishers, and the entire people living in Nigeria to come and join hands together, and make Nigeria a for nations. Foreign investmentors are welcome. Peace
                    and unity is promised our great country, the great pillar of Africa, Nigeria.</p>
                <h4>...NOTE..</h4>
                <P>Up coming will be in November,1,2,3rd 2022. The second summit. Theme Launching and facilitating the investable sustainable and affordable aquaculture and fisheries development in Nigeria. The inland freshwaters of Niger and Benue basins,
                    wetlands and Lake Chad in focus. Marine and brackish waters of the Atlantic ocean and Niger Deltas in focus. Date:6, 7, 8th of September, 2022. <br>
